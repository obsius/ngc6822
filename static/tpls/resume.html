		<h2>Software Engineer at Sixgill</h2>
		<br/>
		I've always enjoyed tinkering around with things, and I developed a love for programming at an early age.  It's allure was that it didn't cost anything, and as a kid, I didn't have any money anyways.
		I didn't have to buy materials, I simply had to delete a few lines, and try again; only time was lost there wasn't any other cost.
		This virualization has allowed computing to quickly spread into every corner and facet of life, and it's done so with rampant fevor.<br/><br/>
		I'm currently living in Santa Monica, CA, but I'm originally from Rohcester, NY.  Southern California is nice, but I do miss Garbage Plates, Genesee Beer, and Scotch Ale; I even miss the cold weather and clouds a little.
